Organisation
Effective study is organised study. 
You’ll need to have all your materials within easy reach, 
and you’ll want to have a system for absorbing them. 
This might mean skimming through everything, identifying problem areas, 
and circling back. It might mean dividing your days up into key 
topics and poring through them, one by one.
